# Follow-the-line

#### Group members: Sara Salim & Nasra Diriye

The Follow the line -project is a simulation of a robot designed to follow a predefined line path using sensors. The main goal of this project was to create a fully functional line-following robot that can independently navigate a predefined path accurately and efficiently. This simulation is designed to help beginners understand basic robotics concepts and allows room for advanced users to experiment and innovate further.

## Key features

- Line detection: The robot uses infrared sensors to detect and follow a line on the ground, adjusting its direction as needed.
- Real-time decision making: The robot makes decisions based on its sensor input to follow the line autonomously without human intervention.
- Simulation: The project uses Webots for robot simulation and Tinkercad for designing the line track.
- Robustness: The robot can follow paths with different shapes and turns, demonstrating its flexibility.

## Technologies and tools used

- Webots: The simulation environment for developing and testing the robot's behavior.
- E-puck robot: The robot model selected within Webots to simulate the line-following task.
- Python: The programming language used for coding the line-following and decision-making algorithms.
- Tinkercad: Application used to design a 3D model as the line track and exporting it into Webots.

While this project was a beginner-level endeavor, it provided valuable hands-on experience with robotics concepts like sensors, algorithms, and decision-making. Though simple, it has laid a solid foundation for more complex projects in the future. We hope this inspires others to explore robotics and look forward to building upon what we've learned.
